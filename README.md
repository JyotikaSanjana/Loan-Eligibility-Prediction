# Loan Eligibility Prediction
Loan eligibility prediction is an important task in the banking and finance industry. The loan eligibility prediction problem is a common challenge faced by banks and financial institutions. The objective of this study is to explore the use of machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of a loan being repaid or defaulted by a borrower. In recent years, machine learning algorithms have shown great potential in accurately predicting loan approvals.
In this project, a machine learning-based loan eligibility prediction model is designed. The model is developed using a dataset consisting of various features such as age, dependents, married, education, applicant income, co applicant income, employment type, property, loan amount, and credit score. The dataset is pre-processed and cleaned before training the machine learning models.

Five models, namely Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, and Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, K Nearest Neighbours are trained and evaluated on the pre-processed dataset. The performance of the models is evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. 
The webpage is designed for banks and financial institutions to automate their loan eligibility assessment process, reduce processing times, and improve their decision-making capabilities. The model is deployed on the webpage using a user-friendly interface, where users can input their information and receive an instant loan eligibility assessment. The webpage is developed using modern web technologies such as Streamlit.

This machine learning model can be used by banks and financial institutions to automate their loan eligibility assessment process and improve their decision-making capabilities. This would also result in faster processing times and a more efficient and accurate assessment of loan applications.
